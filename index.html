        <h3>Welcome to Kookoo’s Nest</h3>
        <p>We are nestled in a tiny private cove of white sand on the very tip of Antulang peninsula, facing the sunset over the sulu sea . Set into a backdrop of wooded slopes and shear cliffs, in an area of outstanding beauty, we consider Kookoo's nest to be an "Eco-lodge" as much as a resort.</p>
        <p>Kookoo's Nest offers recreation and relaxation on a beautiful white sand beach with stunning sunsets and great food. We have six bamboo beach Cottages in a range of sizes to suit families, couples and single travelers. The cottages are surrounded by a pocket of natural woodland with many species of tropical trees and plants including towering coconut palms. As a result you may see many kinds of birds from your cottage balcony or the restaurant, including Kingfishers, Sunbirds, Fantails and many others, so bring your binoculars.</p>
        <p>For recreation, we offer coastal walks, swimming in the clear waters of our private beach and kayaking along the coast, exploring Tambobo Bay and the mangroves. A beautiful coral reef starts just a few meters from the beach, so there are excellent opportunities for snorkeling, and we offer a range of Scuba Diving experiences for beginners to experienced divers, including PADI courses.</p>

            <p>“Staying in kookoo's nest was one of my favorite vacations. It was like we own the place, because it was peaceful and they only have 6 huts. Although it was far from the city, but if you want to get away from the buzz and hassle this is one perfect place. Hoping to get back again.”</p>

            <h5>Sunsets, the best ever</h5>
            <p>“Stunning location, superb hosts Jamie and Nicky, amazing locally sourced food, cheap beer. Then there is the diving. One of the best sites I have visited in 40 years of qualified diving. Tambobo bay, kayaking through the mangrove swamps. Amazing place. Sent my eldest son there just after his 18th. Came back with an advanced. He has just come back from Indonesia where he has been working as a dive master this season. I have told many friends of Kookoos nest. Some have been. We all want to return.”</p>
